# SoundVeil
SoundVeil conceals data in the least significant bits of audio samples, differences that are too slight for humans to detect, but still able to be extracted by SoundVeil's built-in decoder. Futhermore, we offer an additional (optional) layer of encryption using a Vigen√®re cipher.

This was a hackathon submission for YRHacs 2024, developed by *CoolPersonThatCodes, Flyboy, joeyhlu,* and *Larkteryny*.
